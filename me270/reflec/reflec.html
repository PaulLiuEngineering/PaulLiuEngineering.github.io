            <p>Throughout the entire semester, I learn a lot in this class. First of all I developed my technical skill to another level; also I learned how to do extended research about academic topics online; besides that I also learned how to corporate with other mechanical engineers on a project that requires our collective effort. </p>
            <p>Before taking this class, I have only taken ME170 for technical knowledge in design and manufacturing. But after taking this class, I learned more about other manufacturing techniques other than 3D printing. What we learned in ME170(3D printing) is just a part of additive manufacturing. ME 270 branched out to so many other additive manufacturing techniques and even subtractive manufacturing techniques. I also learned a lot about the standards in the manufacturing . Some of them didn’t make sense at first, but after learning the reason for all the standards in the manufacturing industry, I feel like I have a better grasp of what to consider when I design my own product. Besides the manufacturing techniques, I learned more in-depth about materials used for mass-production too. </p>
            <p>The mini-projects every week helped me develop my researching skill on the internet. With the mini-project, you will not simply get a straightforward answer on the first page of the google search, instead you need to do some actual research and understand the material or the topic. Sometimes you will have to read a few academic papers to learn enough about the topics to answer the questions. </p>
            <p>Finally for the e-portfolio I made, I used html, javascript and css. This gave me an opportunity to be more comfortable with building website. I learned a lot about website design and improved the design of the website a lot throughout the course. I learned how to set up my own website for public views and I think I will be able to utilize this skill set later on in other areas.</p>

            <p>Design for Manufacturability, or ME 270, was my favorite course to take this semester. I feel as if the course taught me a great deal about my major and offered us more insight on the industry. I really admired the fact that we worked in teams because that is one of my favorite aspects of engineering. Engineering requires people to work together because the potential that can be accomplished grows exponentially with each additional person and each additional perspective. Working on a team is something I have enjoyed and I also admire the fact that I am able to work well with others. What helps is that sometimes it is difficult for me to grasp a concept well and with a team, I am able to have multiple people try to help me understand the advanced topics we have in this course. </p>
            <p>There were many things that I learned in the field of engineering and it covered a vast array of topics in manufacturing such as Engineering Plastics, Tolerancing, Shape Casting methods, and welding. This was done through the Mini Projects, Main Project, Labs, and Lectures. At first, I didn’t understand the Mini Projects because it was based on things we had not learned in lecture. I even remember Mini Project 1 being confusing because we did not cover any of the things before. However, Professor Liebenberg making them research based helped us learn more because it was additional information we gained other than the lectures and labs.</p>
            <p>The highlights of the course were the lectures. Professor Liebenberg is an exceptional lecturer and I knew everything we were learning was going to be useful when we enter the industry. It is also very good to have someone such as Professor Liebenberg who knows how the industry works to have taught us. Furthermore, having a great lab TA, Nattasit, also made labs enjoyable. Some course challenges were that ME 270 was very different from ME 170 and I wish some aspects of the course were more lenient from the fact that it is a considerable jump but not too the point where ME 270 is unbearable and too difficult. Another great aspect was the fact that exams were not emphasized and Professor Liebenberg made quizzes group work as well and how we could have a sheet for reference. It seems illogical to have students memorize formulas and it is beneficial that Professor Liebenberg recognizes that. This course also did challenge me and I think it was mainly through having to understand the concepts we were learning and how they were applicable to real world situations.</p>
            <p>I believe that all the knowledge we learned in ME 270 will be applied in real life engineering practice. If our employer ask us questions such as how much torque or stress can be applied to a bolt, we know we need to calculate bolt proof strength. If we are asked what temperature we have to make something in order for it to be shrink fit a certain amount into a hole, we know how to calculate that. ((D2 - D1 ) = αD1 (T2 - T1 )).</p>
            <p>Our e-portfolio consists of material presented by all of our group members. We included the CAD drawings and also the first designs of our redesign from each group member. Seeing us improve on an existing design for the bicycle speaker holder made us think and take into different considerations. Our website is a sum of the work we did for the Main Project and is something to be proud of. </p>

            <p>My experience in this Design for Manufacturability course has taught me a number of valuable lessons. First, I have received much more technical knowledge than I ever could have imagined going into this course. Before this semester, I had very little knowledge about the different processes, such as welding and injection molding, which are utilized during the manufacturing process. However, I now have a fairly good understanding of how each process works thanks to the in-depth labs and example problems which he have worked on over the past few months. For example, I have confidence approaching machining problems such as determining the cutting force necessary to reduce the diameter of a metal rod. I also can visualize injection molding thanks to our experience in lab, and I also have an understanding of additive manufacturing processes such as powder bed fusion.</p>
            <p>But beyond acquiring more knowledge in the field of mechanical engineering, this class has especially taught me the value of independent research. In the past, I took for granted the amount of information that is immediately available to me through no more than a quick Internet search. This will undoubtedly aid me further down the line as I continue my academic career. Whenever I am stumped by a problem I am facing, I now know that I have bountiful resources available, and I am no longer limited to just the lecture slides of a given class.</p>
            <p>Although this class has obviously taught me a great deal of practical knowledge that will assist me as an engineer, I believe the most important experience provided in this class was the experience of working on real projects as a team. This gave me practice communicating with team members in a semi-professional environment, and the value of this cannot be overstated. Furthermore, it was very cool to see our main project come together piece by piece, and I am extremely proud of the final bike speaker holder we came up with. Working in a group the way we did has not only provided me with technical experience, but also taught me about my own capabilities, weaknesses, and skills as an engineer.</p>

            <p>My time at this university has been great with respect to my engineering courses. ME270 has strengthened my belief that I am in the right major. Just today, professor Liebenberg listed to the class all of the personality attributes I see in myself (mostly kidding). This semester has been great, getting to work with a great team, learning about all areas of manufacturing, working with creo, and just sitting in lecture listening to all of the amazing things engineers have come up with to make our lives even easier. Getting opportunities to improve my skills at modelling software is always good. I somewhat wish that we had more opportunities to use creo in class, but I understand that we were more focusing on the manufacturing aspect, not design. Everything we have done inside and outside of class was a blast; mini projects: when I could look up how things are made and find out what processes go into everything we see, labs: when we can experience creation of our own design right in front of our eyes, and lecture: when the secret life of the products we use everyday is displayed on the screen. I feel like labs should be more focused on us getting to figure out what is happening with a product and getting to know the process it took to make it, than focusing on the paper we have to write, and answering some questions that only make our brains hurt. Regarding the mini projects, there seems to be a trend where we get 75% of the questions relatively easily, then the other 25% is material we have never been exposed to and is really hard to find online without spending a couple hours looking at the right links. I understand this is school, and nothing is supposed to be handed to you on a platter, but c'mon.</p>
            <p>Learning about how stuff is made is really interesting. I used to watch ‘How It’s Made’ on the tv, and since I was young I wasn't aware of what most of it meant, but I was intrigued nonetheless. This rush of nostalgia came back when we started going over every process throughout the semester. I don't know how much of this material will be useful in the future, but it is really fun to know how it all works. However, just because I may be able to describe how a product is made just by looking at it, doesn't mean I can adequately describe all of the math that went into it. I feel that my shortcomings at math will hold me back some in the future when we have an actual important project that could determine our lives, but I also feel that with time comes understanding, and eventually all of the calculations will be like second nature to me. </p>
            <p>Some things that I know I need to work on are communication and my procrastination. It has been hard keeping in constant communication with my teammates about everything that I was responsible for, and I feel like I should take more of an active role when it comes to certain parts. When it came to describing the processes that it takes to make a product, I can do it in a second, but asking for help about a problem, takes about however long the next video is depending on if i’ve finished my snack. Which leads me into procrastination. I know that almost everyone suffers from it and i’m not special, but I do have a pretty bad case of it. It may just be mental blinders, but once i’ve started something I can’t stop until i’ve completed it or I get hungry. This takes into account almost anything; hw, youtube, video games, projects, papers, 3d printing, food, mostly food, and sleep. All of the mini and main projects were the same way. I couldn't get started without either meeting with the team the day before it was due, or closing all of the fun tabs to focus on the school ones.  I know what I need to work on for my future as an engineer, and for the better of my education as a whole, and will try to do something about it sometime in the near… eventually.</p>

            <p>During my time in the Design for Manufacturability course, I learned a great deal of valuable life information regarding various manufacturing processes and their individual strengths and weaknesses. The knowledge I gained in this course will be extremely useful to me due to there being a high possibility that I will one day work in a team of other engineers with the task of designing a new product from its initial idealization all the way to its large-scale manufacture. For that reason, it is crucial that I understand not only what processes can be used to create my potential product but also design considerations if I plan on using certain manufacturing processes, both of which I have learned from the class material. For instance, I now know that if wanted to weld two pieces of metal together, its very important to take the composition of the two metals into account since certain welding processes aren’t compatible with certain materials.</p>
            <p>One of the highlights of this course was how it taught me how to research new topics both by myself and with a team in a more effective manner. The minilabs were the main contributor to this because sometimes the answer to a question wasn’t immediately apparent and required more in-depth research. Another highlight of this class was the semester long main project. It was extremely fun engaging in the engineering process of product innovation. Everyone wants to be able to invent something but it’s also important to learn how to innovate or improve a product. Its something that every engineer must do, and the labs taught me how to do exactly that through several interesting activities. Going from the brainstorming phase to the ideation phase all the way to a fully functioning prototype was something I had a great deal of fun participating in. The most challenging part of the course was learning the necessary researching skills for our labs and mini-projects. Some of those assignments had me stumped for the better part of a day. Thankfully because of those struggles though, I was able to emerge from this class a much better student than I was went in entered.</p>
            <p>If I had to list my strengths and weaknesses from this course, I would have to say my strengths are my creativity, my illustrations, and my ability to work well in a team. As for my weaknesses, I’d most likely say it’d be my researching strategies, CADing abilities, and organization. In the past, I never had a reason to improve on those skills so when I got to this class, I realized quite quickly just how inadequate I was in those areas. Thankfully, this class offered me the tools and resources I needed to overcome my shortcomings as well as polish my craft.</p>
