            Our team chose to improve the speaker holder. As we inspected our speaker, we noticed that the designers of this product had
            taken into account that this needed to be fit for usage on a bicycle, and one area they factored this into
            was in the materials. It was clear that they knew that the speaker would have to endure the environment it
            would be in, whether it ranged from heavy rain or bumpy roads. They accomplished this by using strong, but
            cheap, injection molded plastic in areas throughout the speaker which included the holder and base. They
            also used a rubber gasket for holding the speaker in the clamp. Upon inspection, one improvement that could
            be made is regarding the speaker clamp where the whole component could be made out of an elastic material
            like rubber. This could reduce the amount of parts required to make this product and reduce the amount of
            material mass as well, resulting in a lighter weight for the speaker. The substitution for the rubber like
            material would grant the holder more friction which in cause would lead to less material required to keep
            it in place.
